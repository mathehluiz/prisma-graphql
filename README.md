# GraphQL with Prisma - Proof of Concept

This project is a **proof of concept** to test the integration between **GraphQL** and **Prisma**. The goal is to determine whether using `include` for table relations is necessary or if **`ResolveField`** alone can handle the relationships efficiently.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **GraphQL**: For API structure, queries, and mutations.
- **Prisma**: ORM for database access.
- **TypeScript**: Main language of the project.
- **Postgres**: For testing purposes.

## ðŸ”§ Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **Prisma CLI**: Install with `npm install prisma --save-dev`

### Installation

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd <REPO_DIR>
npm install
```

### Database setup

1. Apply migrations to generate the database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

2. (Optional) Start Prisma Studio to explore the database:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run start
```

# Implementation Details

### GraphQL Schema

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  email: String!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]
  createdAt: Date!
  updatedAt: Date!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
  createdAt: Date!
  updatedAt: Date!
}
```

### Using `@ResolveField()` to Fetch Relations

Below is an example resolver to fetch posts related to a user. With ResolveField, relationships can be resolved dynamically:

```typescript
@ResolveField('posts')
async posts(@Parent() user: User) {
  return this.postManagementService.getPostsByAuthor(user.id);
}
```

### Fetching with include

Alternatively, you can use include in Prisma to fetch related entities directly:

```typescript
const userWithPosts = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: userId },
  include: { posts: true },
});
```

# ðŸ“‹ Conclusion

It is possible to efficiently use **`ResolveField()`** to manage relationships between entities without the need for **`include`** in Prisma queries. This approach ensures better separation of concerns, as each field is resolved only when needed, avoiding over-fetching data. Additionally, it lessens the **cognitive load**, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.

# ðŸ›‘ Known Issues

- Performance: Using many ResolveField operations may trigger too many database queries.
- Overfetching: include might retrieve unnecessary data.
